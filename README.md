### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dylan

I am currently working at [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) building scalable blockchain data infrastructure with support for over [100+](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/) blockchains. Our API powers thousands of popular applications and professional services. Here are some of the notable features I have shipped at Covalent:
- led the engineering effort to offer our API with industry leading IaaS providers [ChainStack](https://chainstack.com/covalent-on-chainstack-unified-api-web3-data/), [NodeReal](https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/covalent-nodereal-announcement/), and [Blast](https://www.theblock.co/post/236547/blast-joins-forces-with-covalent-to-empower-developers-in-the-web3-ecosystem-with-premium-api-access)
- a cross-chain wallet activity [endpoint](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/unified-api/changelog/#new-premium-wallet-activity-endpoint), a transaction summary [endpoint](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/unified-api/changelog/#new-transactions-endpoints), a transactions + decoded log events by block [endpoint](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/transactions/get-all-transactions-in-a-block/), and rebuilt our events [endpoints](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/base/get-logs/)
- added support for [Unstoppable Domains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/unified-api/changelog/#new-unstoppable-domains-address-resolution) and [Lens Protocol](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/unified-api/changelog/#lens-address-resolution-added) across our API
- a concurrent asynchronous file scraper for indexing terabytes of NFT data powering our [NFT endpoints](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/nft/get-nfts-for-address/#core-rendering/)
- a framework for supporting custom data cube or SQL based endpoints

In the past I worked under [Dr. Alfred Lehar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-lehar-434b2021/) at the University of Calgary where I built a custom Bitcoin ETL indexer in Julia for storing the entire Bitcoin chain dataset in a PostgreSQL database and then enriching the data with third-party data sources.

I have bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and finance from the University of Calgary. During my time there, I was a part of the Schulich Formula Racing Team, where my team:
- won 1st place at our capstone project fair for our custom [power distribution module](https://dylanrae.ca/PDM-details.html)
- developed a wireless tire temperature and pressure monitoring [system](https://dylanrae.ca/TTPMS-details.html)

Some of my past hobby projects include:
- a wi-fi enabled [smart thermostat](https://dylanrae.ca/ST-details.html) with MQTT and historical logging
- training an SSD object detection model for experimental use as a [random number generator](https://dylanrae.ca/ML-details.html)

Currently working on:
- a new tool for greatly simplifying the process of buying used cars
- an easily shareable cross-chain blockchain [wallet stat card](https://github.com/dylanjrae/wallet-share)
